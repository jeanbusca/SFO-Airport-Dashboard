# SFO-Airport-Power Bi report

I created a report using Power Bi desktop that uses the number of passengers at San Francisco airport as numerical metric.
The report allows the user to display the number of passengers between 2006 and 2016 through different dimensions and measures.

The data is public and it has been pulled from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanshetty678/air-traffic-data
